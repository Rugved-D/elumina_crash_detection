# üöó Damage Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a predictive model to determine whether a vehicle will be damaged or not, using customer demographic and insurance policy-related data. The model is developed and evaluated within a Jupyter Notebook, following standard machine learning workflows.
